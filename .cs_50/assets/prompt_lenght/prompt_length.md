1 - Concise
The assistant will return only the most essential information. Responses will be short, focused, and suitable for quick lookups or when you only need a direct answer with minimal context. Ideal for experienced users who understand the context.
2 - Brief
The response includes a bit of helpful context or reasoning without being verbose. You’ll get a short explanation, examples only when necessary, and a practical answer that’s more than a single sentence, but still compact.
3 - Balanced
This is the default level. The assistant provides a moderate amount of detail, balancing clarity and brevity. You can expect clear explanations, light context, and examples when useful, making it accessible without being overwhelming.
4 - Detailed
The model will offer thorough explanations, break down concepts step by step, and use examples to clarify more complex ideas. Best used when learning something new or when you want insight into the assistant’s reasoning.
5 - Extensive
Expect the most comprehensive output. The assistant will explain everything in full, often anticipating related questions. Responses may include in-depth background, multiple examples, edge case considerations, and deeper technical or conceptual analysis.
